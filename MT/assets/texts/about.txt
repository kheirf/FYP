The goal of this project is to develop an application to serve as a convenient tool for aspiring music composers. 

This is so that they can create and share music anywhere, anytime. 

A user may suddenly came up with a tune, they would just play with their instrument or hum the tune which will be automatically notated by the app. 

This application can also serve as an educational tool for individuals that want to learn about music compositions by physically interacting with real instruments.

The proposed system does not do the following functionality:
* Detect pitch from polyphonic sound signal or sound signal that has two or more melody simultaneously.
* Users cannot create harmonic music score sheet, only melodic
* While capturing sound, the user cannot pause and continue. Only stop option will be available.
* Users cannot edit their composition on the application.
